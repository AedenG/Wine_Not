# Wine_Not

## Project Overview
The topic that we have selected is to detect a difference between red and white wine based off their chemical make up. There's a myth that red wines have more sulfates than white wines. There's also a myth that white wines have more sugar than red wines. By combining two datasets, that were created from red and white wine variants from Portugual, we are able to see the properities of the wine. Using machine learning models, we will attempt to answer the following question: Can it be detemined if the wine is red or white based off of the properties of the wine (ex. sulfates and sugar content)?
