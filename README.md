### Red vs White
The topic that we have selected is to detect a difference between red and white wine based off their chemical make up. There's a myth that red wines have more sulfates than white wines, but there's also a myth that white wines have more sugar than red wine. By combining two datasets that were created from red and white wine variants from Portugual, we are able to see the properities of the wine. By applying the properties to machine learing, we are aiming to answer, is based off the sulfates or sugar, is the wine red or white.
